RSA Accumulator Mathematics Verification

Tests that verify the RSA accumulator mathematics are implemented correctly
according to the specification in the user query.

This includes:
- Basic accumulator operations (add, verify, revoke)
- Mathematical properties (w^p ‚â° A mod N)
- Incremental vs batch computation consistency
- Witness refresh after revocation
